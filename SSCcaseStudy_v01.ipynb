    "# Rcupcake: Case study on Simon Simplex Collection database\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Nowadays, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children, being one of the fastest-growing developmental disabilities. Understanding the autismâ€™ comorbidities is a major challenge in healthcare systems and fundamental for the study, treatment and prevention of this disease. Autism has been associated with a wide range of disorders, and many genes are related to it, nevertheless, the nature and extent of the comorbidities of autism at the population level need to be determined. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simon Simplex Collection (SSC) is an autism dataset that contains 2600 simplex families where there is one proband suffering autism, while the father, the mother and a sibling do not present the disease. Following this criteria, patients were recruited during two years and all data has been integrated in one giant system gathering genetic and clinical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rcupcake package allows to retrieve the SSC data for a set of phenotypes extracted from ADI-R regarding the presence or not of at least one de novo mutation in a specific gene. In this case study we will describe how we can analyze a set of phenotypes regarding one specific gene in autism patients. For this purpose we will use as an example the data obtained from SSC. We will focus our attention in the subset of patients that have available data regarding the variable CHD8 gene (Binary variable: at least one de novo mutation in the gene CHD8). The phenotypes of interest for this case study will be, the head circunference, that is known to be associated with de novo mutations in CHD8 gene, and loss of language, facial expression and compulsions rituals, that are some phenotypes that are known to be associated with ASD. We will use this example to show the functionality of the Rcupcake package when both, genotype and phenotype variables are present in the dataset under study.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Goal\n",
    "The goal of the study is to analyze wheter different phenotypes variables and phenotype co-occurrence are associated with ASD in relation to the novo gene mutation in CHD8 gene. More specifically, we will answer the following questions:\n",
    "  1. How can we query SSC data through the BD2K PIC-SURE API RESTful API using R?\n",
    "  2. What are the main demographic characteristics of our study population?\n",
    "  3. What are the main phenotypic characteristics of our study population? \n",
    "  4. Are the phenotype variables statistically related?\n",
    "  5. What are the phenotype co-occurrences of patients with any de novo mutation in CHD8 gene? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rcupcake package\n",
    "The Rcupcake package enables the user to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Query through BD2K PIC-SURE RESTful API\n",
    "2. Explore the data from a demographic point of view\n",
    "3. Analyze the phenotype variables according to their different values, in terms of prevalence and co-occurrence\n",
    "4. Compare statistically each phenotype variable pairs\n",
    "5. Describe the phenotype co-occurrence according to the patient exposure, such as having or not one de novo mutation in a specific gene.  \n",
    "\n",

    "## Installation\n",
